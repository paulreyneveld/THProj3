# TH Project 3

This project was built to satisfy the requirements of the third Treehouse FSJS Tech Degree project. 

My goal in this project was to take a standard HTML form and manipulate it via vanilla JS. Specifically, the JS dynamically populates
menus based on user selections. Furthermore, the JS validates the user inputs by both ensuring that the inputs are appropriate
for their use case and by ensuring that there are no scheduling conflicts with regard to the choices made by the user with regard to
what seminars the user chooses to attend.
